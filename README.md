## Project Information

 - Author: Patrick Lindsay
 - Class: SDEV 372 Software as a Service
 - Winter 2023

## Milestones

 - Project Creation
 - Writing a Web API (This repo is the API)
 - Consuming a Web API
 - Integrating Public APIs
 - Deploying to the Cloud
 
## Project Description

This API will allow you to create a Sudoku application. I always wanted to
create a simple game, but I haden't commited to a project. Sudoku is both
simple and complex. I have a good understanding of the game, and it was fun to
develop using Spring. The more practical purpose of the project is to learn
about RESTful APIs and cloud deployment. The API is built on the Spring
framework using Spring Boot and Java.

I build a front-end application (<a href="https://github.com/lindsaypj/Sudoku-in-the-Clouds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sudoku In the Clouds</a>)
that implements this API using React.js.

## Additional Public API Use
Colormind is a color pallet generator that provides randomly generated complementary
colors. Sudoku in the Clouds uses the Colormind API to privide users with generated themes
which dynamically style the page. Check out their site to see the how it works!
