## Project Description

This web application will allow you to play a Sudoku game from my library of
Sudoku boards. I have always wanted to create a simple game, but I haven't 
commited to a project. Sudoku is both simple and complex. I have a good 
understanding of the game and I think it will be fun to develop using Spring.
The more practical purpose of the project is to learn about REST API creation 
and cloud deployment. The project is built using the Spring framework using 
Spring Boot.

## Additional Public API Use
Colormind is a color pallet generator that provides randomly generated complementary
colors. Sudoku in the Clouds uses the Colormind API to privide users with generated themes
which dynamically style the page. Check out their site to see the how it works!
